# Google-Keep-Clone

A Todo List built using knowledge of Javascript.
I also used Local Storage to store all the data. Added 2 basic operations [Edit, Delete]. 

# Run 

First change the directory to google_keep.

For users using chrome as web-browser 
### `google-chrome index.html`

For firefox users
### `firefox index.html`

A new tab will open in your web browser and you are good to go.
